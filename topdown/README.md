# Residual Self Image — Setup Guide

Hey Ricardo! Here's how to get the project running on your PC.

## 1. Install Godot Engine
We are using **Godot 4.3** (or the latest 4.x stable version).

1. Go to [godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download)
2. Download **Godot Engine - Standard Version** (you don't need the .NET version)
3. Extract the `.zip` file.
4. Move the `Godot_v4.x.exe` to a safe place (like your Desktop or Documents).
5. Double-click it to run the engine.

## 2. Open the Project
1. In the Godot Project Manager, click **Import**.
2. Navigate to this project folder.
3. Select the `project.godot` file.
4. Click **Import & Edit**.

## 3. How to Play
- Press **F5** (or the Play button at the top right) to run the game from the start.
- Press **F6** to run just the currently open scene (good for testing specific levels).

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Move Neo
- **Right Click**: Open Terminal on an object (Doors, Debris, etc.)
- **Typing**: Type commands in the terminal (`unlock`, `delete`, `ping`, `stop`)

---

## Troubleshooting
- **"Script Error"**: Check the Output tab at the bottom.
- **Audio missing?**: We haven't added real audio files yet, just placeholders.
- **Minigames stuck?**: Press `Esc` or click the exit button to close the terminal (if available), or just restart the level with `Ctrl+R` (if running from editor).

Let me know if you have issues!
